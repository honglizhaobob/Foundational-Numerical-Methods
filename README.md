# Foundational-Numerical-Methods

Welcome! This collection consists of several fundamental numerical techniques written beautifully in MATLAB code. 
Although the documentations were a bit lengthy, I hope you can enjoy reading my code and sincerely appreciate if you could point out any improvements
These functions have been originally conceptualized, created, debugged with love and effort. MATLAB is one of my favorite languages and I enjoyed coding the project

# Ideas were guided by Berkeley's MATH 128A course, Spring 2019 by Professor John Strain.
