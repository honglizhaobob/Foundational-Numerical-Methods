# Foundational-Numerical-Methods

I welcome you to my first numerical methods repository!

This collection consists of several fundamental numerical techniques written beautifully in MATLAB code. 
Although the comments were a bit lengthy, I hope you can enjoy reading my code and sincerely appreciate if you could point out any improvements.

These methods have been originally conceptualized, created, debugged with passion and effort. MATLAB is one of my favorite languages and I relished coding these numerical schemes.

The code will be improved on a continuous basis for potential later purposes/applications, last updated: 12/29/2019

## Ideas were guided by Berkeley's MATH 128A course, Spring 2019 by Professor John Strain.
